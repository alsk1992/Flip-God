# Fulfiller

Automate order fulfillment — purchase from source, forward tracking to buyer.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `check orders` | See pending orders needing fulfillment |
| `auto purchase <orderId>` | Buy from source platform |
| `track <orderId>` | Get shipment tracking info |
| `update tracking <orderId>` | Push tracking to selling platform |
| `handle return <orderId>` | Process a return |

## Examples

- "check orders" — see what needs to be fulfilled

## Tips
